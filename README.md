# Drone Object Tracking with ESP Image Data
#### Overview:
This project utilizes Python to track objects using image data transmitted from an ESP mounted on a drone. The program processes the image data, identifies objects, and generates signals to control the drone's movement, enabling it to track the detected object.

#### Features:
* Real-time object tracking: The system tracks objects in real-time, providing continuous feedback for the drone's movement.
* ESP integration: Utilizes an ESP module mounted on the drone to transmit image data to the Python program.
* Left/Right signal generation: Based on the object's position in the image, the program generates signals to control the drone's left/right movement.
